Welcome to Reservamos - Weather project! This guide is here to walk you through getting your project up and running on your local machine. Before we dive in, ensure you have `Node.js` installed on your system. This project requires two environment variables to function correctly.

## üìã Prerequisites

You need the following installed to run this project:

- Node.js (v20.9.0)
- npm (comes installed with Node.js)

You can check if you already have Node.js and npm installed and their versions by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## üõ† Setup

Before starting, you need to set up the required environment variables. You will need:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID`: Your API key for connecting with Unsplash service.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_APP_ID`: Your API key for connecting with OpenWeather service.

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project and add the following lines:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_APP_ID=your_database_url_here
```

Be sure to replace `your_api_key_here` and `your_database_url_here` with your actual values.

## üöÄ Instructions to Start

After setting up your environment variables, follow these steps to start your project:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Change to your project's directory (if you're not there already).

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

3. Install the project's dependencies with npm.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the project locally.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start your NextJS development server on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and visit this address to see your project running!
